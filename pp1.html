      <h2 class="headline">PewDiePie: how the YouTube king clocked up 40m fans and 10bn views</h2></h2>
      <h4 class="byline">Stuart Dredge Thursday 22 October 2015</h4>
      
      <p>With 40 million fans, YouTube star Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg could 
      have his pick of broadcasters if he decided to move into television. 
      But the man whose channel has more than 10bn video views plans to stick
      with his online community. </p>

     <p>Television is just another promotional channel for his online work, 
     rather than the next rung of the entertainment ladder, he argues.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>“I started doing YouTube videos and that’s what I want to keep doing. 
    It seems like maybe some traditional or old media feel intimidated by 
    YouTube being a new medium,” Kjellberg said.</p>
    
    
    <p>“I feel like we are the lucky ones doing YouTube. So I’m going to keep 
    doing what’s fun.”</p>
    
    
    
    <p>Kjellberg launched his YouTube channel in 2010, and has built a huge 
    audience for his vlogs and “Let’s Play” videos, in which he plays a 
    variety of games.</p>
    
    <p>In 2014, his videos were watched nearly 4.1bn times and according to 
    documents filed in the Brighton-based Swede’s homeland, the 25-year-old 
    earned $7.4m (£4.8m).</p>
    <p> Now, the traditional media world has come calling – and with it more
    mainstream attention. Kjellberg released his first book this week, 
    This Book Loves You, through a publishing deal with Penguin Random House, 
    and was recently a guest on high-profile US TV show The Late Show with
    Stephen Colbert.</p>
    
    <p> “It’s been a certain group that knows about me, for sure. A lot of people 
    are still like, ‘What is a PewDiePie?’ But it really is interesting to see, 
    as one of the bigger names on YouTube, that right now there’s a transition
    phase where YouTube is becoming more popular and accepted as a medium by 
    itself,” said Kjellberg.</p>
    
    <p>The online fandom for its stars extends to the offline world too:
    1,400 fans turned up to Kjellberg’s book signing in London last weekend, 
    while he has been mobbed when appearing at online-video industry award 
    ceremonies.</p>

    <p>“I see the numbers that are there online: a lot of people watching and 
    commenting. But you go to these events and think, ‘Oh shit! It’s actually 
    real.’ It’s a really big transition,” he said.</p>

    <p>That transition has also seen Kjellberg become an ambassador of sorts 
    for gaming in general, and the genre of Let’s Play videos in particular.
    His Late Show appearance came shortly after a rival chat show, Jimmy Kimmel 
    Live, mocked the phenomenon. Colbert, by contrast, treated Kjellberg and 
    his viewers with respect.</p>

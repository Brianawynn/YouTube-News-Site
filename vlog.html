      <h2 class="headline">Louis Cole. The Millennial Traveller</h2>
      <h4 class="byline">By: Ian Walker | 26 February 2014</h4>
      
      <p>YouTube vlogger Louis Cole’s life is one of constant worldwide 
      travel and the way he lives and the way he uses the Internet is 
      very much a Millennial thing. </p>
      
    
 
      <img src="images/imagegallery/thumbnails/lc1.jpg">

      
     <p>One of the defining characteristics of the Millennial generation 
     is how they use the Internet. It was Baby Boomers and Generation X-ers
     who invented the Internet and invented all the various bits that make 
     the Internet what it is – and it was it was Baby Boomers and Generation 
     X-ers who then used the Internet to go shopping, to read news, to watch 
     porn and to email each other pictures of cats. The Millennial 
     generation do all that stuff as well, but they also use the Internet 
     to invent things and to invent their place in the world./p>
    
    
    
    <p>This ‘inventing his place in the world’ is quite literally what Louis 
    Cole has done. He has used the Internet to invent an entirely new way of
    being in the world. At the time of writing Cole in is Kenya, he just flew
    there from New Zealand,  before that he was in Australia. After Kenya he 
    is planning to return to Australia. After that he is heading to the USA.</p>
    
    
    <p>How he funds these travels is never entirely clear but it is probably 
    funded from a combination of advertising revenue from his films & 
    sponsorship from the tourist boards of the countries  he visits
    (a lot of his travels involve showcasing tourist attractions such as in 
    his recent trip to New Zealand).</p>
    
    
    
    <p>And this Internet documented, Internet funded journey is how Louis 
    Cole has lived for well over a year. He is constantly heading somewhere else.
    India, Canada, Los Angeles, Japan, Egypt, Uganda, Australia, New Zealand,
    Kenya, Eastern Europe – these are all places he has visited over the last
    year. He moves around the world like the rest of us move about our home 
    towns.</p>
    
    <p>No one has really ever lived like this before. There is something entirely 
    original about Louis’ way of living. Rock bands on world tours, air cabin 
    crews and some salesmen may experience something similar to Louis but their 
    travelling through the world is for some other purpose. Gap year students
    drifting aimlessly through Thailand are probably the nearest we get to what
    he is doing, but they aren’t funding their travel through the very act of 
    travelling (unless they’re drug-dealing gap year students). Also, they are 
    taking a gap year – the implication being that they will return at some 
    point to a more ordinary life. There is no indication that Louis is
    planning to stop his Internet funded and documented nomadic lifestyle.</p>
    
    <p>He has no ties – though he does have a huge global network of friends
    and acquaintances. He has no routine – except for the posting of a video 
    each day. He has no responsibilities – except for the occasional obligation
    (for example) to make a film showcasing bungee jumping in New Zealand.
    He seems to have no plan except to keep moving and thanks to the Internet
    this is what he does. There is something very modern about this.</p>
    
    <p>Much of what Louis Cole does may make little sense to people over
    the age of 40. The question of why he keeps moving, and moving in such a
    pathologically relentless way does crop up. There is a sense that he regards 
    the world as just there for him to move through. It does sometimes feel that 
    Louis Cole’s self absorption (he does film himself every day) doesn’t involve
    too much intellectual curiosity about the world, and he can come across as a 
    bit shallow (in one film he wondered out loud whether he should read books). 
    He is aware of this, and quite often he will resolve to try to get a bit deeper
    about stuff in his videos. Moreover there is nothing shallow about the charity 
    work that plays a part in Louis’ travels. This charity work gives his films 
    a substance that is absent from many a vlogger’s output.</p>

    <p>These criticisms are probably just expressions of the age old truth that
    one generation does not always really understand the next. So what that he 
    doesn’t read books, or that he never offers any insights into the places he 
    visits? That’s not what he wants to do and he certainly can’t be accused of 
    not leading a full life. What he is doing is using the Internet to lead a life 
    of almost unprecedented freedom of movement though the world.</p>

    <p>That is an original and extraordinary thing.</p>
